# Quiz-App-with-Timer-using-HTML-CSS-JavaScript
## Hello readers, I will  Create a Quiz Application with Timer using HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript.
There are three levels or boxes in this software [Quiz App with Timer], and these boxes are displayed one at a time when pressing a particular button.
The "Start Quiz" button is the first thing you see when you arrive at the website, and as soon as you click it, an information window with popup animation emerges.

There are a few quiz conditions and two buttons with the labels "Exit" and "Continue" in this infobox. 
The info box will be hidden when you click the Exit button; however, the quiz box will appear when you click the Continue button.
